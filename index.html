      <h2>Our Story So Far</h2>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <img src="assets/images/image1.jpg" />
        <p>Our first date felt like jumping into the unknown… but with you, it was the softest landing. I didn’t know yet how much you’d mean to me — but I already didn’t want the day to end.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <img src="assets/images/image2.jpg" />
        <p>Gacoan will never taste the same again. That day, between the noodles and our silly jokes, something just clicked — like my heart finally said, "yep, this is the one."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <img src="assets/images/image3.jpg" />
        <p>We didn’t take perfect photos — and that’s what made them perfect. Blurry, goofy, unfiltered… just like us. Just right.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <img src="assets/images/image4.jpg" />
        <p>Who knew a game play would turn into a heart-stealing event? You held the controller, but you were really holding my whole focus.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <img src="assets/images/image5.jpg" />
        <p>One whole chicken. Zero hesitation. we were both too full to walk. If that’s not love, I don’t know what is.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">To the One Who Makes My Life Extra</h2>
    <p class="text-lg">
      A year with you feels like a mix of a rom-com, a meme compilation, and a warm hug — all in one. I never thought someone could be this chaotic, this cute, and somehow still be my peace.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      You’ve made boring days exciting, made me laugh when I wanted to sulk, and somehow convinced me that sharing food is a love language — even gave you my fries… even gave you the chicken skin I usually keep for myself.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      I don’t say it enough, but I love the way you care, even when you act like you don’t. I love the way you pout, your weird late-night thoughts, your laugh, and yes — even your dramatic storytelling.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Thank you for being exactly who you are — loud, soft, funny, clingy, chaotic... and completely, perfectly you. You’ve made this past year the happiest I've ever had.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg font-semibold italic text-pink-600">
      Happy 1st Anniversary. I love you more than Manchester United (yes forreal).
